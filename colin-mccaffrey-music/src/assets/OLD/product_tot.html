        <br>
        Colin McCaffrey's third solo CD Tired Of Town is a vintage sounding record 
        with covers of classic old tunes by Merle Haggard, Hank Williams, Fats 
        Waller, as well as the bluesy title cut and 3 other new originals. Also 
        included are a cover of Pete Sutherland's <i>Wilderness Road</i> and Lewis 
        Franco's <i>September Son. </i>Colin recorded this one the old fashioned 
        way: live with vocals and guitar at the same time. He couldn't resist 
        going back and doing some overdubbing, but the production is sparse and 
        clear. Colin's voice sounds rich and smooth through an old RCA ribbon 
        microphone, and his old 1935 Martin R-18 sounds right at home on the old 
        swing songs. </p>

      <p>COLIN MCCAFFREY, TIRED OF TOWN (Self-released, CD) </p>
      <p>&quot;Colin McCaffrey's new CD, Tired of Town, is a gloriously tidy affair. 
        His third solo release finds the central Vermont singer-songwriter bagging 
        the overdubs for a stripped-down tour of some of his favorite music, past 
        and present. </p>
      <p>McCaffrey makes sure the attention is right where it belongs: on his 
        exceptional guitar, mandolin, fiddle, bass and vocal abilities. Except 
        for a guest piano appearance by local mix master Chuck Eller, and some 
        sweet baritone ukulele by Vermont musician Lewis Franco, Tired is all 
        McCaffrey, all the time. </p>
      <p>The album's vocals were recorded with a vintage RCA ribbon microphone, 
        and the result is pleasantly warm and cozy. McCaffrey's gentle crooning 
        is like vintage James Taylor, but with a more pronounced twang. </p>
      <p>On Fats Waller's classic &quot;Honeysuckle Rose,&quot; McCaffrey whistles 
        the horn solos straight from one of the pianist's most famous Bluebird 
        recording sessions. Hank Williams' plaintive &quot;Weary Blues From Waiting&quot; 
        features a lovely and understated guitar solo. There's a bare-bones reading 
        of Merle Haggard's &quot;Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down,&quot; while Jimmie Rodgers' 
        &quot;Mississippi Delta Blues&quot; comes with an authentic yodel. </p>
      <p>McCaffrey's gorgeous take on the 1920s Tin Pan Alley chestnut &quot;Bye Bye 
        Blackbird&quot; is nestled alongside four originals that fit well with his 
        eclectic selection of covers. </p>
      <p>The disc also features two cuts by Franco and Pete Sutherland. That these 
        gifted Vermont songwriters would allow McCaffrey to record their tunes 
        even before they had done so themselves is a testament to his reputation 
        as a respected studio and onstage musician. </p>
      <p>Tired of Town's spare, lovely arrangements leave no place to hide. But 
        talent like McCaffrey's needs no obstruction; he goes out on the ledge 
        with confidence.&quot; - ROBERT RESNIK, Seven Days</p>

      <p>Colin McCaffrey: 'Busiest musician in town' May 19, 2006 </p>
      <p> East Montpelier singer-songwriter Colin McCaffrey recently issued his 
        third solo album, "Tired of Town." If there is an award for "busiest musician 
        in Vermont," Colin McCaffrey of East Montpelier should win it. McCaffrey 
        is a singer, a multi-instrumentalist, an accomplished songwriter, a producer 
        of quality albums - he won the Times Argus award for best producer for 
        2005 - and a performer in so many groups and partnerships that one wonders 
        when he sleeps. </p>
      <p>Add to this list of accomplishments his third solo compact disk: "Tired 
        of Town." This CD highlights McCaffrey's talents as a singer, musician, 
        instrumentalist and songwriter. It's a sparse but intimate work, mostly 
        singer and guitar, playing in a variety of songs with a unifying theme. 
        He has chosen classic tunes that give the CD a southern flavor, with a 
        tone that is decidedly not 21st century. There's virtually no electric 
        guitar here, mostly acoustic with some resonator guitar played for its 
        blues/old-time feel. Tunes such as "Honeysuckle Rose," "Bye Bye Blackbird," 
        "Weary Blues from Waitin'" and "The Bottle Let Me Down," said McCaffrey 
        in an interview, have long been in his solo repertoire and long requested 
        for recording by his fans. </p>
      <p>McCaffrey gives a nod to Vermont's other multi-talented producer-performer 
        Pete Sutherland on the fine song "Wilderness Road," a tale of Vermonters 
        fighting in the Civil War. This song, McCaffrey explained, was learned 
        when performing with Sutherland. </p>
      <p>"It's one of the most powerful tunes I've done," he said. McCaffrey also 
        includes "September Son" by Calais' Lewis Franco. Here Franco, also an 
        accomplished songwriter, contributes ukulele. McCaffrey said this song 
        is in line with the feel of the album, as "a restful, retreating kind 
        of feel, not a hyperactive song, with a vintage sound." This song also 
        has a special place in his heart for he, too, is a September son. </p>
      <p>The song line-up on "Tired of Town" reflects McCaffrey's interest in 
        early 20th century American music. "Honeysuckle Rose" is pre-Depression 
        as is "Bye Bye Blackbird." "Everybody Loves Her" by the Delmore Brothers, 
        who were contemporaries of Bill and Charlie Monroe, comes from the late 
        1930s. McCaffrey's own composition, "Old Guitar," played on resonator 
        guitar is another nod to music of that time. Here McCaffrey shows off 
        his yodeling ability, yet another surprise in this performer's bag of 
        musical tricks. </p>
      <p>"Gypsy," also from McCaffrey, is a fine tune with a timeless sound, written 
        in the Sutherland style, with a haunting melody also played on the resonator 
        guitar. McCaffrey said it is not an accident that this album gives a nod 
        to an earlier, country, blues and southern sensibility. </p>
      <p>"I've been doing so much production, and I've been accused of being Mr. 
        Slick, that I wanted do songs in their purest form." In this vein, he 
        has achieved his goal. Early 20th century country music, such as might 
        be heard from Mississippian Jimmie Rodgers, the "Singing Brakeman," comes 
        to mind. It was this style, recently popularized in the movie "O Brother 
        Where Art Thou?" that was the vehicle for bringing rural musical forms 
        to the urban population of America before World War II. Rodgers performed 
        with little more than a guitar to back his music. Blues, too, was a solo 
        art form and singers like Robert Johnson presented most early blues recordings 
        with only a guitar. McCaffrey, as much as is possible in 2006, is true 
        to this style on this CD. </p>
      <p>"This is the type of music I like to listen to, old scratchy 78s," McCaffrey 
        explained. He admits that music presented this way "is a pretty naked 
        style of production." For much of this album McCaffrey sat down with a 
        guitar and vocal mike and recorded the songs in just one take. Later he 
        returned to the songs overdubbing some mandolin, fiddle and bass where 
        needed. Why work this way? </p>
      <p>"I was going for a straight-up feel. I didn't want to candy it up too 
        much," said McCaffrey. "It goes with the title. I wanted to keep this 
        album simple. "It doesn't mean in the future I won't produce an opus," 
        he quipped. In previous CDs, his first, Nashville produced "What We've 
        Got," and his second, Vermont produced "Make Your Way Home," McCaffrey 
        relied on studio musicians to flush out his work. With "Tired of Town" 
        McCaffrey has found the perfect vehicle for this style of music. With 
        minimal instrumentation, a wide variety of songs from his own songbook 
        and that of other, strong composers, he has achieved a very well rounded, 
        easy to listen to and satisfying album. </p>
