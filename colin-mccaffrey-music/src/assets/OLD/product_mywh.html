        <br>
        <i>Make Your Way Home</i> is a collection of 14 original songs, many inspired 
        by life in the Vermont hills Colin calls home. These stories are full 
        of mountains, valleys, river's and roads that steer the listener through 
        the diverse landscape of Colin's musical and creative life. His lifelong 
        passion for mountain music, swamp rock, backwoods blues and country folk 
        makes this album an atlas of American roots music. Voted in the top-10 
        Vermont releases for 2003 by both Seven Days and The Burlington Free Press.</p>

      <p>Self-produced and recorded, this CD features the work of two other native 
        Vermonters: the beautiful singing of Patti Casey, and the tasteful Dobro 
        and Pedal Steel work of Jim Pitman. Phil Carr provides drums for three 
        of the cuts, Jeremiah McLane plays accordion, and Jason Bergman guests 
        on fiddle. Colin wrote and sang them all and plays the lion's share of 
        the instruments, displaying his facility and flair with the Guitar, Bass, 
        Mandolin, and Fiddle.<!-- nested buy table: --> </p>

        Reviews:</font> </span> </b></font></p>
      <p>&quot;This is an almost perfectly balanced, beautiful-sounding bluegrass/folk 
        record packed with high-quality songs and high-caliber musicianship... 
        The vocal blend between McCaffrey, Patti Casey and Jim Pitman (also on 
        dobro and pedal steel) is so smooth it’s almost magical. Landscapes and 
        longing hearts get equal time here, creating a well-grounded mountain 
        feel. Mix a little James Taylor, a bit of Randy Travis and a dash of early 
        Neil Young and you’ve got a decent reference point. Colin McCaffrey is 
        a picker, strummer and in-tune whistler who on his “homemade” album has 
        many good songs...Double-extra recommended.&quot; </p>
      <p align="right">- COLIN CLARY Sevendays</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;A rootsy standout among the singer-songwriter set, 
        McCaffrey, 35, is an East Montpelier multi-instrumentalist who plays just 
        about everything on his warm-sounding sophomore disc -- guitars, fiddle, 
        mandolin and banjo, to name a few -- though he also benefits from some 
        quality backup work by pedal steel/dobro picker Jim Pitman and singer 
        Patti Casey, among others. Mixing old-time bluegrass, folksy Americana 
        and a comforting vocal tone that falls somewhere between Peter Rowan and 
        James Taylor, McCaffrey is a Green Mountain treasure worth unearthing."</p>
      <p align="right">- TOM HUNTINGTON Burlington Free Press</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;East Montpelier-based musician Colin McCaffrey’s new 
        CD "Make Your Way Home" is a true gem. Fusing folk and bluegrass, this 
        fourteen-song collection shimmers with a stripped-down ear-catching groove, 
        one that remains fresh after repeated spinning. If you listen closely, 
        it becomes apparent that these tunes bears the mark of a singular organizing 
        presence, and you would be right in this observation. McCaffrey (husband 
        of Alia Waking author <a href="http://www.laurawilliamsmccaffrey.com">Laura 
        Williams McCaffrey</a>) is a multi-talented virtuoso whose grand design 
        is exhibited throughout this, his second recording. His voice, reminiscent 
        of James Taylor punctuated by a bit of high, wide, and lonesome, resonates 
        with a beautiful clarity. This guy can sing. He also plays close to a 
        dozen instruments - acoustic and electric guitars, basses, fiddle, mandolin, 
        banjo, shaker, lap percussion and "heavy breathing" (listen closely) – 
        and he plays them really well. His writing, spare, catchy, and clever 
        - is a pleasure to the ear; his songs are poignant and witty without being 
        at all sappy or obtrusive. My family’s current favorite – the hooky "Got 
        the Most of You" (McCaffrey chooses to begin this tune, like many, with 
        the chorus – an unconventional but very savvy arranging decision). And 
        yes, McCaffrey also produced his own recording, blending together a wide 
        variety of tracks into a seamless and unified whole. It has been a long 
        time since I’ve enjoyed a folk/bluegrass collection as much as this one, 
        and I don’t plan to take it out of my CD player any time soon.&quot;</p>
