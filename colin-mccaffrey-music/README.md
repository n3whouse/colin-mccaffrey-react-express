# Left to do

1. 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘗𝘩𝘰𝘵𝘰 𝘊𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘵𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘈𝘓𝘓 𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴 𝘪𝘯𝘤𝘭𝘶𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴 (𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦-𝘸𝘳𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘳, 𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘵𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭)
2. continue injecting pseudo for readability, context and grouping for CSS, and removing redundant classes.
3. Implement paypal button and maybe venmo? Maybe switch "Buy Now" to dropdown like Order Physical Copy but with different buttons for purchase links available
4. add descriptions, starting with events but for the whole thing
5. Add link classes for specific control of underlining links on producer + songwriter page.
6. implement conditional paypal button with "Order physical copy" button?
