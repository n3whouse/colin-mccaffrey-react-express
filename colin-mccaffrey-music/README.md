# Left to do

1. conditional Photo Credits on ALL images including show images (image-wrapper, creditContent conditional)
2. continue injecting pseudo for readability, context and grouping for CSS, and removing redundant classes.
3. Implement paypal button and maybe venmo? Maybe switch "Buy Now" to dropdown like Order Physical Copy but with different buttons for purchase links available
4. add descriptions, starting with events but for the whole thing
